Features
Interactive Board: Users can place queens on the chessboard by clicking on the squares, visualizing how the N-Queens problem is solved.

Backtracking Algorithm: The visualizer employs a backtracking algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem efficiently, demonstrating the process step by step.

Responsive Design: The visualizer is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Educational Purpose: This project serves as an educational tool for learning about algorithms, specifically backtracking, and understanding how they can be applied to solve real-world problems like the N-Queens puzzle.

Usage
To use the N-Queens Visualizer:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Place queens on the chessboard by clicking on the squares to start the visualization.
Observe how the backtracking algorithm solves the N-Queens problem step by step.
